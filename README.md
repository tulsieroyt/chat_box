## ðŸ’¬ Overview

**ChatBox** is a production-quality messaging application designed to demonstrate the power of Flutter combined with the Firebase suite. It offers a complete solution for real-time communication, from user registration and login to instant message delivery and media uploads. This repository serves as a perfect starter kit or reference for building your own chat app.

## Key Features

*   **Secure Authentication:** Robust user login and registration using Firebase Authentication (Email/Password and Google Sign-In).
*   **Real-Time Chat:** Instantaneous message sending and receiving, powered by Cloud Firestore's real-time streams.
*   **Image Sharing:** Users can select and send images from their device, which are uploaded to Firebase Cloud Storage.
*   **User Presence System:** See which users are currently online and active.
*   **Clean, Modern UI:** An intuitive and visually appealing user interface that makes chatting a pleasure.
*   **Profile Management:** Users can manage their profile information.
*   **Fully Cross-Platform:** A single codebase that runs natively on both Android and iOS devices.


## Tech Stack & Architecture

*   **Framework:** **Flutter**
*   **Language:** **Dart**
*   **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):** **Firebase**
    *   **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication
    *   **Database:** Cloud Firestore (for real-time data)
    *   **Storage:** Firebase Cloud Storage (for media files)
*   **Key Packages:** `firebase_core`, `firebase_auth`, `cloud_firestore`, `firebase_storage`, `image_picker`, `google_sign_in`.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these instructions carefully.

### Prerequisites

*   **Flutter SDK:** Make sure you have the latest stable version installed. [Flutter Install Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
*   **Firebase Account:** You will need a free Firebase account.
*   **IDE:** Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter plugins installed.

### Installation & Execution

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tulsieroyt/chat_box.git
    cd chat_box
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```

## Firebase Setup & Configuration

**This is a critical step.** The app will not run without connecting to a Firebase project.

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:** Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.

2.  **Add FlutterFire CLI:** If you haven't already, install the Firebase CLI and configure FlutterFire:
    ```sh
    # Install the Firebase CLI
    npm install -g firebase-tools
    # Login to Firebase
    firebase login
    # Activate the FlutterFire CLI
    dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
    ```

3.  **Configure the App:** From your project's root directory (`chat_box/`), run the following command. This will guide you through selecting your Firebase project and automatically generate the necessary configuration files for Android, iOS, and Web.
    ```sh
    flutterfire configure
    ```
    This command will create `firebase_options.dart` in your `lib` folder and configure the native platforms.

4.  **Enable Firebase Services:**
    *   **Authentication:** In the Firebase Console, go to the "Authentication" section. Click the "Sign-in method" tab and enable **Email/Password** and **Google**.
    *   **Firestore:** Go to "Firestore Database," click "Create database," and start in **Test mode**.
    *   **Storage:** Go to "Storage" and click "Get started."

5.  **Run the Application**
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```
